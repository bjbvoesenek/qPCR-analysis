The qPCR analysis web-interface is designed to conveniently and intuitively plot amplification plots and melting curves. In addition, it automates the calculation of the relative gene expression, calculates the efficiency of every primerset used,  and plots this data in a clear way. Both the LightCycler480 and BioRad systems are suitable, but require different preparation of the Excel files

**Analysis of the LightCycler480 output**
Before using the qPCR-analysis website, the data coming out of the LightCycler480 needs to be transposed. Use the http://humgen.nl/scripts/transpose/ website and use the manual written before by Maurice Overzier.
After copying the data to excel, remove the data from empty wells (wells of the plate where you did not pipet anything in). Name this sheet ‘Data’. Name every sample as following: cell_primer (eg. Control1_GAPDH).

Go to LinRegPCR and use the ‘Determine Baselines’ function, according to the manual of Maurice Overzier. This will create ‘Data_output’ and ‘Data_compact’. Do not change the names of these sheets or any of the column names within these sheets.

If you exported melting curves from the LightCycler480, copy the content of the .txt file to your Excel file in a new sheet named ‘Melting curves’. Delete columns (both X and Sample) of empty wells.

Go to https://humgen.nl/scripts/qPCR-analysis/ and upload your Excel(*.xlsx) file that you want to analyze. Press ‘Submit’ and follow further instructions on the website.

Your results will be ready and downloaded within a minute. Your download will consist of three folders: ‘Input’, ‘Figures’, and ‘Data’. The Input folder contains your input file, the housekeeping genes, and normalizer cell lines selected for this analysis. The ‘Figures’ folder contains figures generated by the script. You will find amplification plots (qPCR_plots_sorted.PDF) and the melting curves (Melting_curves_sorted.PDF). Both these figures are sorted in a way that every row is a cell line, and every column a gene. This makes it easy to compare cell lines and see which samples are different.

Other figures include bargraphs showing the triplicate average Ct value of each sample, the relateive expression values of each sample, and the efficiency of the primersets used. Control lines are represented by gray bars, other lines by blue bars.
The ‘Data’ folder contains Excel sheets with the average Ct per condition or the relative gene expression per condition, so that you can make figures yourself as well. 



**Analysis of the BioRad output**
Before uploading the excel file to the website, there are a few steps you need to do. Firstly, rename the sheet containing the Cq values to ‘Cq’. In the column ‘Sample’, name the samples containing the mq control ‘mq’ or ‘MQ’. If you exported melting curves, copy the content to a new sheet in your excel file that you are going to analyze. Rename this sheet to ‘Melting curves’.
